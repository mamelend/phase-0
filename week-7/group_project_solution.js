//Accountability_Group_2 JavaScript Telephone

// My role in the group is:
//Guillermo - Release 1: Tests to User Stories
//*** Miguel -  Release 2: User Stories to Pseudocode ***


// Here is my part of the challenge:
/*
creation a function sum that takes in a list of numbers
create a variable to hold the sum
FOR EACH element in the list of numbers
add (+=) the number to the sum
return sum

creation a function mean that takes in a list of numbers
FOR EACH element in the list of numbers
add (+=) the number to the sum
RETURN sum / amount of numbers

creation a function median that takes in a list of numbers
SORT the numbers in the list
if the amount of numbers in list does not divide evenly by 2, set a count equal to amount of numbers / 2.
return index at count
else if the amount of numbers in list divides evenly by 2, return ((index at (sum / 2 - 1) + index at(sum / 2)) / 2)


**Write test code for the following strings
sum tests
1,2,3,4,5,5,7 (=> outcome should be 27)
4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7 (=> outcome shoule be 43)
mean tests
1,2,3,4,5,5,7 (=> outcome should be 3.857142857142857)
4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7 (=> outcocme should be is 5.375)
meadian tests
1,2,3,4,5,5,7 (=> outcome should be 4)
4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7 (=> outcome should be 5.5)
