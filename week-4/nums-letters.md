**What does puts do?**

* puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line *

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

* An interger is a whole number. A float is used to represent numbers with decimal points.*


**What is the difference between float and integer division?**

* A float will give you a more precise, arthmatic output. Where as an interger will round down to the nearest whole number.*


**How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

* intergers like 5 and 2 when divided by each other will give you 2, because 2 goes into 5 a total of two times with a remainer of one. Interger division isn't concerned with remainders. Floats like 5.0 and 2.0 when divided will yield a more accurate answer 2.5. Floats are commonly used for math and physics equations, where as integers are good for keeping track of items that can not be divded.*
