**What does puts do?**

* puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line *

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

* An interger is a whole number. A float is used to represent numbers with decimal points.*


**What is the difference between float and integer division?**

* A float will give you a more precise, arthmatic output. Where as an interger will round down to the nearest whole number.*


**How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

* intergers like 5 and 2 when divided by each other will give you 2, because 2 goes into 5 a total of two times with a remainer of one. Interger division isn't concerned with remainders. Floats like 5.0 and 2.0 when divided will yield a more accurate answer 2.5. Floats are commonly used for math and physics equations, where as integers are good for keeping track of items that can not be divded.* 


```ruby
Release 2.1:
puts 24 * 365

Release 2.2:
puts 60 * 24 * (365 * 10 +2)
```

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**

* Ruby has predefined methods that can be called on integers that will handle basic arithmetic. The symbols +, -, *, and / respectively provide the coresponding math. *

**What is the difference between integers and floats?**

* Integers are whole numbers, Floats contain decimals.*

**What is the difference between integer and float division?**

* Integer division will return the most times a number can be divded into another, while intege division will provide the fraction.*

**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**

* Strings are a group of characters linked together in a sequence. You can use them to display information to a user.*

**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**

* local variables are variables defined within a certain document whose definitions are contained within the document. *

**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**

* The challenge seemed like a lot fo work at first glance, but the work was relatively straight forward and easy to accomplish. I think I have a good feel for the basics.*
