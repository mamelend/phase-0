1) My model, concerning a customer, a games retailer, and purchased games, demonstrates a one to one relationship because the games don't necessarily have dlc, and so to always have slots for that information could potentially leave a lot of empty space in the database.

**What is a one-to-one database?**

* A one-to-one database is a table that refers to one specific instance where an entity may or may not contain exactly one peice of data. *

**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

* When a peice of data wouldn't neccsarily exist but could possibly, and there are several fields that would be needed to keep track of that data.*

**What is a many-to-many database?**

* A many-to-many database is one that reflects two data sets that can both have several instances of each other. For example, Authors and Books. An author can have written more than one book, while a book can have several authors. *

**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

* You would use it to record where these two sets of data intersect. *

**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**

* Generally it makes sense, I think this is one of those things that will be reinforced through practice and applicaiton.*
