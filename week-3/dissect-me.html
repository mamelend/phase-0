      I signed up for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> specifically because of the phase-based program structure with an emphasis on developing the <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/what-is-emotional-intelligence-eq/">EQ</a> of an individual along with their <a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-increase-my-IQ-1">IQ</a>. The phase-based program allows me the space I need to really learn the material, instead of forcing myself to rush in order to meet all of the deadlines. Of course my goal is to finish the program the week before Christmas and move into a new chapter of my life in the first week of 2016, but it is very important to me that I graudate the program after soaking up as much as possible before the technical interviews and the new job training begins. I've been passionate about the growth mindset after reading <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/salman-khan/the-one-world-schoolhouse/9781455508372/">The One World Schoolhouse</a> and am excited to be a part of a learning environment where the capacity to learn is emphasized as robustly as the curriculum.

        <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> clarified some of my assumptions and further reinforced that this program is the right choice for me. One week in and I'm already scrambling a bit to make furthter adjustments in my life to accomodate the workload of Phase 0. I've been a work-at-home-mom for over five years now, and there are a lot of things I'm going to need to adjust about my schedule and mindset in order to manage the demands of my future job. Phase 0 is not only preparing me for Phase 1, 2, and 3 of the DBC program, but also is providing me a glimpse into what my work-life balance is going to be like after DBC graduation. Attending a program without something like the Phase 0 ramp-up period and the Phase 1/2/3 holistic approach to developing a person instead of just a programmer would have been a recipe for mental/emotional collapse for me.

        I most appreciated the frank talk about a student's employment prospects post-graduation. Becoming employable is as important as the amount of programming skills a student absorbs, and employability and a firm grasp of a wide-variety of programming principles are not always the same thing. I was already approaching the program with a growth-mindset, but now I'll be striving to focus less on checking the "completion" box for each assignment, and more on developing the unique skillset I can take from this intense experience and leverage into a choice employment opportunity in January 2016.

  <h2>The Fireside Chat:</h2>
      <p>
      Much of what was discussed here seemed to coincide with my thoughts of how it will be like walk through the doors of Dev Bootcamp, come October. For one, I can absolutely identify with the notion that some are sincerely worried about how they will stack up, or whether or not they will merely be able to grasp the various concepts of software development. I think that Shereef’s response to this idea is encouraging in that he seems very confident that the people that have made it through the admissions process are capable. I like the emphasis on concentrating on developing or fostering a hunger to learn, rather than worrying about how much you currently know.

      I like the idea of concentrating on the more social aspects of software development. It seems that Dev Bootcamp has identified this sort of hidden art in how to teach people to work together and I am very much looking forward to putting that into practice. I also like the idea of students constantly learning from each other and having techniques and best practices spread throughout the cohort. I like the idea of discussing the importance of emotional empathy and things such as race, gender, etc. because I feel that as a culture there is a real lack of understanding when it comes to these issues. I look forward to engaging as someone with a Sociology and History background, and of course given my personal experience in order to add something to the discussion.

      I don’t know that my expectations have changed much, I think the video is in line with what I have come to expect from Dev Bootcamp, which by the way, is a very positive thing. I am both excited and nervous at the idea of learning so much in such a short amount of time.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Article was one I didn't use much but I think I will begin to incorportate it into my design in the future. I like to use header, footer, and nav becasue they clearly define the use of the elements.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are displayed from top to bottom, parent to child. Stylings can effect this, but usually this is how things are displayed.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned a few shortcuts and also about snippits, which seem super useful. I will stay vigilant for new shortcuts!
